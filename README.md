# List Manager

**Privacy-first list and notes management with optional AI assistance**

A simple, fast, and private tool that stores your data locally on your computer. Create any type of list or note (travel, shopping, projects, ideas, etc.), search and organize them, and optionally get AI-powered suggestions and writing assistance using your own AI API key (Claude, ChatGPT, or Gemini).

## Features

- **Privacy First**: All data stays local on your computer. No accounts, no tracking, no cloud servers.
- **Persistent Storage**: Data saved to filesystem for reliability (no more lost lists or notes from browser cache clears!)
- **Flexible Lists**: Create any type of list with categories, tags, priorities, and deadlines
- **Markdown Notes**: Write rich notes with markdown formatting, live preview, and split-pane editing
- **Notes Browser**: Browse all notes in grid or list view, grouped by category, with drag-and-drop reorganization
- **Smart Search**: Real-time search across lists, notes, categories, tags, and items
- **AI Assistance** (Optional):
  - Get item suggestions for lists
  - Generate TLDR summaries for notes
  - Grammar and spelling checking for notes
  - Improve writing - restructure and clarify notes
  - Generate opposing viewpoints for critical thinking
  - Supports Claude, ChatGPT, or Gemini (use your own API key)
- **Export/Import**: Backup your data anytime as JSON files
- **PDF Export for Notes**: Export individual notes to PDF with formatted styling and optional metadata
- **Light & Dark Themes**: Choose your preferred theme or use system settings
- **Mobile Friendly**: Responsive design works on all devices
- **Cloud Backup**: Notes stored as markdown files, easily backed up to any cloud service (Tresorit, Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.)

## Quick Start

### 1. Download & Setup

1. Download this repository as a ZIP file
2. Extract it to a folder (e.g., `Documents/ListManager`)
3. Install Node.js (if not already installed): [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
4. Open Terminal/Command Prompt in the extracted folder
5. Run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
6. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`

**Note**: The development server is required for the app to work properly. This ensures your data is saved reliably to the filesystem instead of browser storage.

### Running Persistently with PM2 (Optional)

After the initial setup, you can run List Manager continuously in the background without needing to run `npm run dev` every time. This approach uses PM2, a process manager that keeps your app running and auto-starts it on system reboot.

**Setup (One-time):**

1. Install PM2 globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g pm2
   ```

2. Navigate to your List Manager folder and start the app with PM2:
   ```bash
   pm2 start server.js --name list-manager
   ```

3. Enable auto-start on system reboot:
   ```bash
   pm2 startup
   pm2 save
   ```

4. Verify it's running:
   ```bash
   pm2 list
   ```

**Optional: Add a Local Domain Name**

For easier access, you can add a local domain instead of using `localhost`.

1. Open your hosts file:
   - **Mac/Linux**: `sudo nano /etc/hosts`
   - **Windows**: Open `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` as admin

2. Add this line:
   ```
   127.0.0.1 listandnotes.local
   ```

3. Save and close

Now you can access the app at: `http://listandnotes.local:3000`

**Useful PM2 Commands:**

```bash
pm2 restart list-manager    # Restart the app
pm2 stop list-manager       # Stop the app
pm2 start list-manager      # Start it again
pm2 logs list-manager       # View live logs
pm2 delete list-manager     # Remove from PM2
```

**Advantages of this approach:**
- ✅ No need to run commands every time
- ✅ Auto-starts on computer restart
- ✅ App runs in the background
- ✅ Easy to manage with PM2 commands

## Data Management

### Exporting Data

Click "Export All" to download all your lists as a JSON file. This creates a backup you can keep safe.

**Recommended**: Export your data regularly, especially before:
- Clearing browser data
- Trying the import feature
- Making major changes

### Importing Data

1. Click "Import" button
2. Select your previously exported JSON file
3. Your lists will be restored

**Note**: Importing will merge with existing data, not replace it.

**Import File Format:**

The import file must be a valid JSON file with this structure:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "exportDate": "2025-01-15T00:00:00.000Z",
  "lists": [
    {
      "id": "unique-id",
      "name": "List Name",
      "category": "travel",
      "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
      "priority": "high",
      "deadline": "2025-03-01",
      "favorite": false,
      "items": [
        {
          "id": "item-id",
          "text": "Item text",
          "completed": false,
          "notes": "",
          "addedDate": "2025-01-10T10:00:00.000Z",
          "source": "user"
        }
      ],
      "metadata": {
        "created": "2025-01-10T10:00:00.000Z",
        "modified": "2025-01-10T10:20:00.000Z",
        "itemCount": 1,
        "completedCount": 0
      }
    }
  ],
  "settings": {
    "apiKey": "",
    "display": {
      "view": "grid",
      "theme": "light",
      "itemsPerPage": 20
    },
    "ai": {
      "enabled": false,
      "autoSuggest": false
    },
    "version": "1.0.0"
  }
}
```

**Required fields for each list:**
- `id` - Unique identifier
- `name` - List name (required)
- `items` - Array of items (can be empty)

**Example**: See `assets/sample-data.json` for a complete example with 3 sample lists.

**Tips:**
- You can create your own JSON files manually following this structure
- Export your data first to see the exact format
- The import validates the structure before importing

### Clearing All Data

In Settings → Data Management, you can clear all data. **This cannot be undone!** Export first.

## Privacy & Security

**What stays local:**
- All your lists and items (saved to `local_data/lists.json`)
- All your notes (metadata in `local_data/notes.json`, content in `local_data/notes/*.md`)
- Note backups automatically created before grammar updates (`local_data/.backups/`)
- All settings (saved to `local_data/settings.json`)
- Your API key (saved to `local_data/.env.local` - git ignored for security)
- Everything!

**What goes to external services:**
- Only AI feature requests go to your chosen AI provider (when you use AI features)
- Your API key is sent with AI requests (required for the API to work)

**Security Features:**
- ✅ **Input Validation** - All user inputs are validated for type and length on both client and server
- 🛡️ **XSS Protection** - Markdown rendering is sanitized with DOMPurify to prevent injection attacks
- 🔒 **Security Headers** - HTTP response headers prevent common web attacks
- 📏 **Size Limits** - Enforced limits prevent large payload attacks (10MB requests, 1MB notes)
- 🔄 **Auto-Backup** - Notes are automatically backed up before grammar updates are applied
- 💾 **One-Click Restore** - Restore from backup if anything goes wrong

**No tracking:**
- No analytics
- No cookies
- No cloud servers
- No external requests (except AI provider when you use AI features)

**Data Location:**
- Your data is stored in the `local_data/` folder within the app directory
- The `local_data/` folder is excluded from git (see `.gitignore`)
- You can backup the entire `local_data/` folder to preserve everything
- Note backups are stored in `local_data/.backups/` for automatic recovery

## Tips & Tricks

**Keyboard Shortcuts:**
- `Cmd/Ctrl + B`: Toggle notes sidebar
- `Cmd/Ctrl + N`: Create new note
- Press Enter in the "Add item" field to quickly add items

**Organization:**
- Use categories for broad grouping (travel, work, shopping)
- Use tags for cross-category themes (urgent, planning, research)
- Star your most important lists as favorites

**Backup Strategy:**
- Export your data monthly
- Keep exports in a safe folder or cloud storage
- Name exports with dates: `list-manager-backup-2025-01-15.json`
- Or backup the entire `local_data/` folder

**Performance:**
- The app works great with 100+ lists and 1000+ items
- All data is saved to JSON files in the `local_data/` folder
- Clear completed items from old lists to keep things tidy

## Browser Compatibility

**Fully Supported:**
- Chrome/Edge 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

**Requirements:**
- JavaScript enabled
- Node.js 18+ installed (for running the dev server)

## Troubleshooting

**App not starting?**
- Make sure Node.js is installed: `node --version`
- Run `npm install` first
- Check if port 3000 is already in use
- Check Terminal/Command Prompt for error messages

**Lists not saving?**
- Ensure the dev server is running (`npm run dev`)
- Check that the `local_data/` folder exists
- Check file permissions on the `local_data/` folder
- Look for errors in the Terminal/browser console

**AI features not working?**
- Verify your API key is correct
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure you have API credits remaining with your provider
- Test the connection in Settings
- Check the browser console for detailed error messages

**Data disappeared?**
- Check the `local_data/` folder for `lists.json` and `settings.json`
- Look for exported backup files
- If you had old localStorage data, the app should have offered to migrate it

**Server won't start?**
- Port 3000 might be in use. Stop other apps using that port, or change the port in `server.js`
- Try `npm install` again
- Check for errors in Terminal output

## FAQ

**Q: Is this really free?**
A: Yes! The app is free and open source. AI API usage costs apply if you use AI features (you pay your chosen provider directly).

**Q: Can I use it offline?**
A: The dev server needs to run, but it runs locally. Everything works without internet except AI suggestions.

**Q: Where is my data stored?**
A: In the `local_data/` folder on your computer. It never leaves your device (except AI requests if you use that feature).

**Q: Can I sync across devices?**
A: Not automatically. Use Export/Import to manually transfer data between devices, or sync the `local_data/` folder with cloud storage.

**Q: Is this secure?**
A: Your data stays local. If you use AI features, your API key and list data are sent to your chosen AI provider over HTTPS.

**Q: Can I customize it?**
A: Yes! All the code is here. Modify the CSS for styling or JavaScript for features.

**Q: What if I lose my API key?**
A: Generate a new one from your AI provider's console. Update it in Settings. Old keys can be deleted.

**Q: Why do I need to run a server?**
A: The server enables filesystem storage (more reliable than browser storage) and AI features. It runs locally on your computer.

**Q: Can I still use it without AI features?**
A: Yes! AI features are completely optional. The app works great for managing lists and notes without any AI.

**Q: Can I use Notes without Lists?**
A: Yes! You can use just Notes if you prefer. Click the "Notes" tab and ignore the Lists tab entirely.

**Q: What markdown features are supported in Notes?**
A: Full markdown support including: headers, bold/italic, lists, links, code blocks, tables, blockquotes, images, and more.

**Q: How do I access my notes on my phone?**
A: Your notes are stored as markdown files in `local_data/notes/`. Point your cloud storage app (Tresorit, Dropbox, Google Drive) to sync this folder, then use any markdown editor on your phone to view/edit them.

**Q: Can I convert a List to a Note?**
A: Not automatically, but you can copy list items and paste them into a note. The items become markdown formatted text.

**Q: Are notes encrypted?**
A: Notes are plain markdown files stored locally. They have the same privacy as lists. If you use cloud storage for sync, use a service with encryption (like Tresorit).
